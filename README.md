# knights-travails
This project tested my BFS undertanding and skill. I found it challenging as I have more gaps in my undertanding than I realised. I will look deeper into this using other resources. 
However, I learned how to do professional reasearch for my projects. There's no way I would have known where to start without the following sources:
- [Describing Graphs by Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/describing-graphs)
- [A* Search Algorithm by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
- [Dijkstra's Algoright by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
- [BFS For a Graph by Geeks For Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph/)

# Features
- The knightMoves function helps you find the shortest path or lowest number of moves you can make when playing a knight moving from one block to the other anywhere on the board.
